          <h2>Why Me?</h2>
          <p>
            I've got the academic creds ‚Äî ranked top of my high school class, top 10 in my generation, and nationally recognized for English essay writing. But what matters more? I get real results.
           </p>
          <p>
            I helped a YouTuber double their subscribers in just one month, and grew a gym owner's business 4x with strategic, persuasive writing.
          </p>
    		  <p>
    			In my free time, I‚Äôm an avid climber, volleyball player, skier, regular at the gym and a lifelong learner (yes, even mastered the Rubik‚Äôs cube). I pick up new niches fast, dive deep into the details, and turn complex ideas into clear, compelling writing that sells.
    		  </p>
    		  <p>
    			From fun, slangy Gen Z vibes to professional tone for serious products ‚Äî I can do it all. But I especially love crafting emails, captions, and video scripts that connect and convert.
    		  </p>
    		  <p>
    			Let‚Äôs create something that clicks.
