          <p>
            Ranked top of my high school class, among the top 10 of my school generation, and one of the top in the country in English essay writing. I‚Äôve helped a YouTuber double their subscribers in a single month, and helped a gym owner grow their business by 4x with sharp, persuasive copy. Whether you need fun & slangy captions for a Gen Z crowd or professional tone for a serious product ‚Äî I‚Äôve got you.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love writing emails, captions, and video scripts that connect with your audience and get them to *act*. Let‚Äôs make it happen.
